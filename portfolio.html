            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate and ambitious student currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications (BCA). My journey through technology has led me to develop a strong interest in both front-end and back-end web development, and I’m dedicated to becoming a well-rounded web developer.

I am focused on mastering the complete web development stack, from creating visually appealing and responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to building robust, efficient back-end systems using "Node.js," "Python," "databases like MySQL or MongoDB My goal is to create seamless user experiences powered by solid back-end functionality.

As I continue my studies, I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world projects, working closely with clients to build websites and applications that not only look great but also perform flawlessly. I believe that the best solutions come from a deep understanding of both the front-end user experience and the back-end logic that supports it.</p>
